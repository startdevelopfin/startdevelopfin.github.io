<p>Tennessee State University is committed to connecting Historically Black Colleges and Universities to the diverse applications of digital technology through its partnership with Apple. By design, the C2 Student Leadership Conference helped students to network with students at various institutions while building relationships with the Innovation Team faculty.

<h3>Swift Coding Clubs ‚ö°Ô∏è</h3>

<p>I told my story from the beginning to help connect the dots for folks wondering how I arrived at this point. My goal was to encourage the audience to explore Swift and to show that joining or creating a Swift Coding Club is a great way to start their journeys.

<p>Being technical, creative, and solution-oriented is important. But I also spoke about the importance of being imaginative, optimistic, and persistent. Everyone can code, and luckily, getting started with SwiftUI is easier than ever due to the wonders of Swift Playgrounds. </p><br></br>

<h3>I have an idea! üí°</h3>

<p><blockquote><i>"Photo of speaker and audience"</i></blockquote></p>

<p>During my talk, I shared the challenges and obstacles I faced while traversing UIKit and SwiftUI. Although it took a lot of patience,  I learned enough Swift to bring my passion project to life. Attendees received a sneak peek of By Rule (SwiftUI version) and some new features coming this September.</p><br></br>

<h3>By Rule üèÄ</h3>

<p>By Rule is an iOS app and basketball rules companion. It is the most robust college basketball rules app ever!</p>

<p><blockquote><i>"Photo taken at Tennesee State University"</i></blockquote></p>

<p>The conference allowed me to meet a diverse group of students, program managers, engineers, and more. For nearly an hour, I spoke candidly about my journey learning the Swift programming language, becoming a software engineer, and imploring all those listening to join or create a Swift Coding Club at their respective institutions. Over the following day, I was very encouraged by the positive feedback from several attendees at the Student Leadership Conference. I'm thankful for the opportunity and will be looking forward to my next speaking engagement!</p>
