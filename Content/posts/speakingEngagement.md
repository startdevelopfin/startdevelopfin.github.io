<p><blockquote><i>"Photo from Denmark Technical College Summer 21' Coding Cohort "</i></blockquote></p>

<p>I spoke about learning Swift and the importance of being imaginative, optimistic, and persistent. Being technical, creative, and solution oriented is equally important. Eveyone can code, and luckily, getting started with SwiftUI is easier than ever thanks to the wonders of Swift Playgrounds. </p><br></br>

<h3>I have an idea! üí°</h3>

<p>The conference allowed me to meet a diverse group of students, program managers, engineers and more. For nearly an hour, I spoke candidly about my journey learning Swift, becoming a software engineer, and implored listners to look for opportunites to mentor the next generation. The positive feedback I received at various points of the conference was very encouraging. I'm definitely looking forward to my next speaking engagement!</p>
