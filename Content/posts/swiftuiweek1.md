## What I Learned This Week 📱

This week was all about **Swift fundamentals and basic data types**. 

- **Basic Data Types**: Variables, constants, integers, doubles, strings, and booleans
- **Collections**: Arrays, dictionaries, and sets
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals (if/else), switch statements, and various loop types
- **Functions**: Creating, parameterizing, and returning values from functions
- **Enumerations**: Creating and using basic enums in Swift
<br></br>

## The Power of Swift's Type System ✅

If I had to highlight just one thing I learned from this week, it would be **Swift's strong type system**. The type system stands out to me because it provides safety and clarity without disrupting the readability of my code.


## Code Spotlight 💡: Building a Temperature Converter

Here's a practical example of how I'm applying what I learned this week. A simple, intuitive SwiftUI app that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Designed with best practices in mind, this app provides a clean user interface, real-time conversion, and accessibility support.

### State Management ⚙️

<br></br>

### Enum 🔑

<br></br>

### Conversion Logic 🧮

<br></br>

### User Interface ✨

## Challenges I Faced

The biggest hurdle was deciding how to condense what I learned into a simple app. I overcame it by building around one of the challenges I completed earlier in the week.
<br></br>

## Key Terms I'm Adding to My Vocabulary 📝

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|---|---|
| **Type Inference** | Swift's ability to automatically determine a variable's type based on its initial value |
| **String Interpolation** | Embedding variables within string literals using `\(variableName)` syntax |
| **Collection Types** | Swift's three primary collection types: arrays, sets, and dictionaries |
| **Control Flow** | Structures that change the order in which code is executed (if/else, loops, switch) |
| **Parameter Labels** | External names for function parameters that make function calls more readable |
<br></br>

## Next Week's Focus 🎯

Looking ahead to Week 2, I'll be diving into:

1. **Closures** - Swift's elegant functions on steroids
2. **Structs** - Creating custom data types with value semantics  
3. **Classes** - Object-oriented programming in Swift
4. **Protocols and Extensions** - The secret to Swift's flexibility
<br></br>

## What I'm Excited to Try Next 🔮

I can't wait to experiment with more complex functions in my app. I'm planning to use them to create reusable components for data validation and formatting. Stay tuned!
