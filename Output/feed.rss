<p>The conference allowed me to meet a diverse group of students, program managers, engineers, and more. For nearly an hour, I spoke candidly about my journey learning the Swift programming language, becoming a software engineer, and imploring all those listening to join or create a Swift Coding Club at their respective institutions. The next day, I felt incredibly encouraged by the positive feedback I received from numerous attendees at the Student Leadership Conference. I'm thankful for the opportunity and will be looking forward to my next speaking engagement!</p>

These events typically occur in various locations across the globe. But due to the sudden onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many were relegated to remote experiences instead. These conferences offer a platform to share the latest technologies and techniques by bringing together the brightest minds in the field to share their expertise. Industry leaders, speakers, and attendees can use the forum to present new ideas to foster collaboration within the community.</p><p>In this post, I reflect on the experience of attending my first Swift conference and detail the potential impact of these community-driven events for aspiring and existing developers.</p><br></br><h3>Deep Dish Swift üçï</h3><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/by-rule-90fbd.appspot.com/o/DeepDish%2FDeepDishBanner.jpg?alt=media&token=dddb58d4-7996-49bb-94a5-8a9bb4c2d519" alt="Deep Dish Swift Banner" style="height: 300px;"/><p>I decided to go to Chicagoland for my first developer conference, <a href="https://deepdishswift.com">Deep Dish Swift.</a> Over three-hundred attendees were present. Developers converged in a large conference room. I could not help but feel excited because Day 1 was devoted to Indie Devs. I am nearing completion of converting my UIKit app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/by-rule/id1532845521">By Rule</a> to SwiftUI, so the time to learn about mastering subscriptions, shipping faster, and optimizing for the App Store was now more than ever. Immediately, I found value in attending the conference.</p><p>Each day, talented members of the Swift community took the stage and presented thorough talks that explored a wide range of topics. Speakers regaled us with tales from their careers and kept the atmosphere lively with cheeky memes peppered throughout their slides. Notably, three of the twenty conference speakers were Black. Including Black speakers in a Swift conference is extremely important and has a significant impact. It shows that the community recognizes the value of having diverse perspectives and experiences.<p>

<p>By having Black speakers share their challenges and successes, other Black developers can feel more connected to the community and inspired to pursue their careers in Swift development. As one <a href="https://twitter.com/abeck617">conference-goer</a> noted on Twitter, the impact of seeing Black speakers presenting at a conference was inspirational. Check out the tweet below:</p>

<h3>Diversity in Swift üé®</h3>
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/by-rule-90fbd.appspot.com/o/DeepDish%2FDeepDishSlide1.png?alt=media&token=f8df07d2-7390-49d1-99af-d2306a53ac2e" alt="Deep Dish Slide" style="height: 200px;"/>
<p><blockquote><i>"Photo from Paul Hudson's closing keynote slide"</i></blockquote></p>

<p>According to a 2022 survey by Stack Overflow, only <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-demographics-gender">4.8%</a> of professional developers identify as women, and only <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-demographics-race-and-ethnicity">1.27%</a> identify as Black. This lack of representation can lead to a lack of diversity of thought and perspectives, limit innovation, and hinder progress.</p>

<p>The broader societal issues that affect underrepresented groups, such as systemic racism and sexism, contribute to the lack of diversity in the Swift community.</p>

<p>Gatekeeping refers to setting up barriers that prevent new or underrepresented individuals from accessing resources, networks, or opportunities. Examples include discouraging or dismissing ideas, excluding or belittling newcomers, or making it difficult for people to enter the community. Additionally, many underrepresented individuals may experience a lack of entry-level support, meaning they do not receive adequate training or resources to succeed in their roles or advance in the field once they finally arrive.</p>

<p>Mentoring and paid internships can play a vital role in reversing these trends by increasing diversity and representation in the Swift community, especially for individuals who may not have access to traditional networks and resources. Quality guidance from industry professionals combined with paid opportunities can help when it comes to identifying areas for growth and encourage newcomers to persist in the face of adversity during these deeply troubling economic times.</p><br></br>

<h3>Tips for Attendees üí°</h3>

<p>Attending a Swift developer conference can be beneficial for developers in many ways. Attendees have the chance to learn about new frameworks, tools, and techniques, as well as to network with peers and receive feedback on their projects. As a result, conferences can broaden a developer's perspective, inspire new ideas and approaches to programming, and provide access to resources not otherwise available.</p>

<p>I noticed a few things that impacted the overall experience at my first conference. I have listed them below and hope you will consider them the next time you attend. Here are 7 Tips to Maximize Your Next Conference Experience:</p>

<li><h4>Tip #1: Be on time ‚è∞</h4></li>
<p>Arriving for the conference on time set the tone for the entire day. A new experience can be nerve-wracking. Getting settled in with plenty of time to spare let me relax and mentally prepare myself.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #2: Sit somewhere new everyday üëÄ</h4></li>
<p>Where you decide to sit may seem trivial, but it can impact your visibility and the number of connections you can make. I sat somewhere new daily and found it to be very beneficial.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #3: Take high level notes üìù</h4></li>
<p>There was no way I could sit and absorb all of the information and visual stimuli on display at the conference. Taking high-level notes allowed me to maintain my focus on conference speakers while stopping only to write down information pertinent to me from each talk.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #4: Make a new connection everyday üëãüèø</h4></li>
<p>This tip is crucial for developers at all stages. Do not be afraid to say hello to someone new. Chances are they are nervous too. I made a few new connections by exchanging emails, reaching out on social media, and hanging out after hours.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #5: Ask questions ‚ùì</h4></li>
<p>Whether it is a conference speaker, sponsor, or peer, asking quality questions is crucial. I cannot wait to delve deeper into Machine Learning and put the knowledge I gained to use.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #6: Share your experience üó£Ô∏è</h4></li>
<p>Standing in a room full of accomplished industry professionals can be intimidating. However, we all have to start somewhere and have unique experiences to share. Sharing updates about my projects and receiving positive feedback felt good.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #7: Take pictures üì∏</h4></li>
<p>Document the moments that matter to you! I took a lot of pictures to preserve the memory of the occasion.</p>
<br></br>

<h3>Conclusion üí≠</h3>
<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/by-rule-90fbd.appspot.com/o/DeepDish%2FDeepDishBadge.png?alt=media&token=3f32edf8-564d-4075-bbdb-95328c0a7a4d" alt="Deep DIsh Badge" style="height: 300px;"/>

<p>While there have been efforts to increase representation in the Swift community, progress has been slow. The lack of significant improvement could be due to broken interview practices, implicit bias or discrimination during the hiring process, and a failure to provide consistent material support. There is still much work to do.</p>

<p>I believe conferences should prioritize diversity and inclusion efforts, including actively seeking out and inviting Black speakers and attendees, providing mentorship and networking opportunities, and creating safe spaces for underrepresented groups. Organizers and attendees should be mindful of codes of conduct to ensure everyone feels respected and valued.</p>

<p>My first Swift conference was truly memorable. I got to explore a different city and try out the local cuisine. I learned something new from the various talks, met many great developers, and made new friends too! I was even fortunate enough to receive an affirming round of applause for my <a href="https://startdevelopfin.github.io/posts/codingdtc/">work mentoring last summer</a>. I will never forget that moment. If you are on the fence about attending a Swift conference, let this be the nudge you need to find your way to an event near you.</p>

<h4>Shoutout to the <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepDishSwift">Deep Dish Swift</a> team for organizing the event!</h4><br></br>

<h3>Call to Action üö®</h3>

<p><blockquote><i>"Photo of Paul Hudson's closing keynote slide"</i></blockquote></p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws">Paul Hudson's </a> entire closing keynote was sensational. He took the stage and implored attendees to avoid bickering over superficial coding debates and focus on what matters -- building the apps we care about, looking for opportunities to provide mentorship regardless of our experience, challenging the status quo, and moving forward together.</p>

<p>I have a similar ask for every reader from the Swift community: Find a way to make an impact and foster positive change. Maybe that looks like lobbying for paid internships or entry-level support where you work. Perhaps that looks like joining an organization like <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org">Underdog Devs</a> and providing sponsorship or mentorship for aspiring developers. We all have a role to play. The future of the Swift community depends on the actions we take right now.</p><br></br>

I'll also explain how students with little to no coding experience leveraged the power of SwiftUI and Swift Playgrounds to build apps using an iPad (8 min read).</description><link>https://startdevelopfin.github.io/posts/codingdtc</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 14:55:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>DTC UB Coding 2022 üë®üèø‚Äçüíª</h1><h3>Brief Introduction</h3><p>My name is Daniel J. Aupont, I am an iOS Developer, but that was not always the case. Basketball is my favorite pastime. After high school, I decided to pursue a career in officiating. It is a discipline that allowed me to showcase my best strengths: teamwork, physical fitness and endurance, technical acumen, and poise amidst the most strenuous of environments or circumstances. My dream of becoming one of seventy-ish NBA basketball officials in the world meant I had to work diligently to understand the rules of the game to adjudicate them at the highest level.</p><p>For context, your odds of successfully reaching the pinnacle of basketball officiating is worse than making it as a player...and those odds are ~1 in 3333(0.03%). There is not exaclty a school for officiating. Collegiate camps are often exclusive. If you are lucky enough to secure an invite, officiating camps can be very pricey and rarely do campers attend just one. It can feel like a trial of attrition each summer. I desperately needed a modern, less expensive avenue to digest the game and increase my skills.</p><p>I needed to create a reliable and consistent approach to studying the game. I built my first iOS app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/by-rule/id1532845521">By Rule</a>, and fell in love with the process of solving real world problems with a little help from technology. Leveraging sofware to take an idea from hypothetical to tangible is quite the thrill. Download the app or visit the website <a href="https://byruleapp.com">byruleapp.com</a> to learn more. Stay tuned as app updates roll out January 2023!</p><p>I cannot say I ever thought I would be writing this blog post. Sometimes, an idea can dramatically change the course of your life. When I pivoted to iOS Development, it was hard to find my niche because I wanted to feel like my work impacted my community. When I was younger, it meant the world to have someone that looked like me teach me something cool. The chance to show thirty plus black students in-demand skills -- skills that could help them solve real world problems and potentially earn entry into a career they may not have once considered -- was not something I was willing to pass up. The opportunity to inspire young students and prepare them for success came via Denmark Technical College Upward Bound summer enrichment program. On relatively short notice, I flew from New York to South Carolina to instruct the 2022 Coding cohort at the college. I am so glad I did.</p><h3>The Opportunity of a Lifetime</h3><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D1BAQFoA4GVMrXAtQ/company-background_10000/0/1561064993777?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jkxDQLvuaAD_lm9r2PegJ64wk7a1yqk31cNuwz09Elc" alt="DenmarkTechnicalCollege"/><p><em>Fig.1 - Denmark Technical College</em></p><p>Denmark Technical College is a public, historically black, two-year technical college located in rural Bamberg County, South Carolina. It is a city chalk full of kind and hardworking people. The staff at the college are some of the most genuine people I have ever met. The students are no different. The Upward Bound program provides support services to these high school students in order to prepare them to graduate from high school, enroll in college, and graduate with a degree. Visit the <a href="https://www.denmarktech.edu">Denmark Technical College</a> website to learn more.</p><h3>The Power of SwiftUI</h3><p>UIKit is really awesome, full stop. But I would like to a give a shoutout to SwiftUI and declare it as the future of Swift programming, especially for newer developers. The speed at which you can prototype apps is mind-blowing. The declarative syntax, means you can state what your user interface should do in an easily digestible manner. You can create one or many previews in light or dark mode to get sample data using the design canvas, and you can inspect your user interface live since the Swift compilier constantly runs and builds your app.</p><blockquote><p><em>"SwiftUI helps you build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift ‚Äî and surprisingly little code. You can bring even better experiences to everyone, on any Apple device, using just one set of tools and APIs...And if you want to use an interface element that isn‚Äôt offered in SwiftUI, you can mix and match SwiftUI with UIKit and AppKit to take advantage of the best of all worlds"</em></p></blockquote><p>I knew I wanted to show the students the power of SwiftUI, so all that remained was developing a solid curriculum. When I sat down to think about what mode of learning would most effectively engage the students without overwhelming them, all roads pointed back to one of the most innovative applications of this decade. An app that served as an educational tool, was free to use and therefore substantially more accessible, and could handle shipping to the App Store all in one would be a game-changer. Conveniently enough, such an app exists and is known as Swift Playgrounds for iPad.</p><blockquote><p><em>"Swift Playgrounds is a revolutionary app for iPad &amp; Mac that helps you learn to code and build apps using Swift, the same powerful language used to create world-class apps for the App Store. Learning to code with Swift Playgrounds is incredibly engaging because the app comes with a complete set of Apple-designed lessons and walkthroughs. The lessons demonstrate the core concepts of coding and building apps as you write real Swift code in an interactive environment"</em></p></blockquote><p>Clear instructions(thanks Apple!) coupled with nice visuals made learning relatively simple, even for complete beginners. Students being able to build and subsequently show their friends and family the fruits of their labor would be instant gratification and a significant confidence boost. The low barrier for entry would also increase the likelihood that they would continue learning after the program concluded. All I needed was access to some iPads to unlock the untapped potential of these students. Luckily, the college had received devices from Apple. There were just enough to ensure we could create a coding cohort for students that were interested.</p><p>The pre made playgrounds were very well constructed. Students could explore different learning paths and wrestle with a variety of topics. Their introduction to SwiftUI began with the Swift Playgorunds app Getting Started with Apps. I would not stop there, though. Students received a coding assesment to measure competency and an About Me project to encapsulate their learning. The final curriculum included but was not limited to:</p><ul style="padding:20px;">
<li>Inspecting code via the Preview Window</li>
<li>Creating SwiftUI views like Text views</li>
<li>Providing Arguments</li>
<li>Modifying SwiftUI views using Dot Notation</li>
<li>Adding Image views and image modifiers</li>
<li>Working with Buttons and Shapes</li>
<li>Creating containers like VStack and HStack</li>
<li>Composing new views with stacks and organizing them</li>
<li>Designing a User Interface</li>
<li>Leveraging Fonts and Colors</li>
<li>Coding Assesment</li>
<li>About Me capstone project</li>
</ul><h3>Challenges</h3><p>Class size was relatively small to begin the program. In fact, we watched the 2022 WWDC Keynote with just two students present on the first day. But by the end of the week, I was instructing three separate classes. The program consisted of twenty black girls and thirteen black boys, most of which were under-classmen. Keeping high school students focused and engaged on coding, considering their limited exposure, was a challenge. They needed to know there was a point in learning these new coding concepts -- that the skill was applicable in some way that would prove beneficial to them.</p><p>There were students that came into coding class optimistic. It was a fresh start at learning something new and a chance to start thinking about how to approach their app ideas for the future. But as lessons intensified, so did the frustrations. Errors from floating characters or missing curly braces left some students feeling a bit confused at times.</p><p>Students needed time to explore the iPad and understand how to navigate Swift Playgrounds. For most, it was the first time using an iPad and their first foray programming with Swift. I prompted them to see who owned an iPad or Macbook at home. The silence was enough to hear a pin drop. But after a quick chat with the IT department, I got the students each assigned an iPad to use during down time! Having a physical device to take back to the dorms for practice was paramount to stoking student intrigue and directly impacted their growth as young coders.</p><p>I also quickly discovered how important the length of class was. I needed time to prep, clean and santize before the start of each class to protect against Covid-19, set up the display and configure Zooom links, print out class notes, etc. Students also needed time each day to get settled in, and there had to be time to review for students who may have been absent. Each one-hour class session was often reduced to forty-five miutes between the trickling in of new students, routine stopping for errors, general questions, and the typical high school class hijinks.</p><h3>A Multifaceted Approach</h3><p>Although my time was limited, I felt it necessary to cover as many bases as possible because every student learns differently. I wanted to find a way to consistenly capture the students focus because learning to code is doable, but it can certainly be tricky at times.</p><p>First, I introduced a guest speaker to share their insights working in tech. Secondly, I de-mystified the app building process by showing them apps I have personally built and components of their favorite apps. Lastly, I provided after hours support via a Coding-Club, for students that either struggled with certain concepts or wanted to learn more.</p><p>Every day during leisure hours, students could come back to the classroom to catch up on class work and were encouraged to ask more pointed questions after having been exposed to the material earlier. They received advanced lessons and guidance regarding future projects they wished to create. Some students would find me during our lunch period to let me know they were sneaking ahead of the lessons to learn more.</p><p>I asked the students questions about their experience coding this summer, but you will have to watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/754154977">DTC UB Coding Video</a> to hear what they had to say. You can also check out some of the About Me projects they were working on by downloading the testflight beta <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/TJJagXSC">DTC UB22</a> app. Not every student completed their project, but I am still incredibly proud of how hard they worked to create their own views and provide the apps content.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>When I began coding, I felt lost every day. Coding can be intimidating, but I did my best to convey to the students that it gets easier over time. I think an overlooked aspect of learning to code is the support and encouragemnt from those already in the community. Having consistent help and clear feedback makes a big difference when you feel stuck and want to give up.</p><p>My main takeaway is that these students appreciate genuine help and do not take it for granted. Providing material support to young black girls and boys is far superior than offering tired platitudes backed with bare bones initiatives. Denmark is home to intelligent, creative, and driven students. They made the commitment to enrich themselves this summer and remained engaged for four weeks, even as they took other summer classes. And as evidenced by the coding video, the students were not only receptive but eager to start building their own apps. They are excited to showcase their creativity and want to make a lasting impact on the world. But they need the continued support from what I know to be a great commnunity.</p><p>So I have a simple request for whomever is reading this post: take the time to find out how you can get involved, whether thats monetarily or with your physical presence. Support todays youth because they will soon become the Innovative, Transparent, Diverse and Excellent leaders of tomorrow.</p><p>Instructing the coding class this summer was a moment I will never forget. Teaching is a great way to gain new perspectives and reinforce what you already know. There were trials, but ultimately it was a rewarding experience.

I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to impact these students and cannot wait to see what comes next.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
