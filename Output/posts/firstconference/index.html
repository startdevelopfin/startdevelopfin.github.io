These events typically occur in various locations across the globe. But due to the sudden onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many were relegated to remote experiences instead. These conferences offer a platform to share the latest technologies and techniques by bringing together the brightest minds in the field to share their expertise. Industry leaders, speakers, and attendees can use the forum to present new ideas to foster collaboration within the community.</p><p>In this post, I reflect on the experience of attending my first Swift conference and detail the potential impact of these community-driven events for aspiring and existing developers.</p><br></br><h3>Deep Dish Swift üçï</h3><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/by-rule-90fbd.appspot.com/o/DeepDish%2FDeepDishBanner.jpg?alt=media&token=dddb58d4-7996-49bb-94a5-8a9bb4c2d519" alt="Deep Dish Swift Banner" style="height: 300px;"/><p>I decided to go to Chicagoland for my first developer conference, <a href="https://deepdishswift.com">Deep Dish Swift.</a> Over three-hundred attendees were present. Developers converged in a large conference room. I could not help but feel excited because Day 1 was devoted to Indie Devs. I am nearing completion of converting my UIKit app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/by-rule/id1532845521">By Rule</a> to SwiftUI, so the time to learn about mastering subscriptions, shipping faster, and optimizing for the App Store was now more than ever. Immediately, I found value in attending the conference.</p><p>Each day, talented members of the Swift community took the stage and presented thorough talks that explored a wide range of topics. Speakers regaled us with tales from their careers and kept the atmosphere lively with cheeky memes peppered throughout their slides. Notably, three of the twenty conference speakers were Black. Including Black speakers in a Swift conference is extremely important and has a significant impact. It shows that the community recognizes the value of having diverse perspectives and experiences.<p>

<p>By having Black speakers share their challenges and successes, other Black developers can feel more connected to the community and inspired to pursue their careers in Swift development. As one <a href="https://twitter.com/abeck617">conference-goer</a> noted on Twitter, the impact of seeing Black speakers presenting at a conference was inspirational. Check out the tweet below:</p>

<h3>Diversity in Swift üé®</h3>

<p><blockquote><i>"Photo from Paul Hudson's closing keynote slide"</i></blockquote></p>

<p>According to a 2022 survey by Stack Overflow, only <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-demographics-gender">4.8%</a> of professional developers identify as women, and only <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-demographics-race-and-ethnicity">1.27%</a> identify as Black. This lack of representation can lead to a lack of diversity of thought and perspectives, limit innovation, and hinder progress.</p>

<p>The broader societal issues that affect underrepresented groups, such as systemic racism and sexism, contribute to the lack of diversity in the Swift community.</p>

<p>Gatekeeping refers to setting up barriers that prevent new or underrepresented individuals from accessing resources, networks, or opportunities. Examples include discouraging or dismissing ideas, excluding or belittling newcomers, or making it difficult for people to enter the community. Additionally, many underrepresented individuals may experience a lack of entry-level support, meaning they do not receive adequate training or resources to succeed in their roles or advance in the field once they finally arrive.</p>

<p>Mentoring and paid internships can play a vital role in reversing these trends by increasing diversity and representation in the Swift community, especially for individuals who may not have access to traditional networks and resources. Quality guidance from industry professionals combined with paid opportunities can help when it comes to identifying areas for growth and encourage newcomers to persist in the face of adversity during these deeply troubling economic times.</p><br></br>

<h3>Tips for Attendees üí°</h3>

<p>Attending a Swift developer conference can be beneficial for developers in many ways. Attendees have the chance to learn about new frameworks, tools, and techniques, as well as to network with peers and receive feedback on their projects. As a result, conferences can broaden a developer's perspective, inspire new ideas and approaches to programming, and provide access to resources not otherwise available.</p>

<p>I noticed a few things that impacted the overall experience at my first conference. I have listed them below and hope you will consider them the next time you attend. Here are 7 Tips to Maximize Your Next Conference Experience:</p>

<li><h4>Tip #1: Be on time ‚è∞</h4></li>
<p>Arriving for the conference on time set the tone for the entire day. A new experience can be nerve-wracking. Getting settled in with plenty of time to spare let me relax and mentally prepare myself.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #2: Sit somewhere new everyday üëÄ</h4></li>
<p>Where you decide to sit may seem trivial, but it can impact your visibility and the number of connections you can make. I sat somewhere new daily and found it to be very beneficial.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #3: Take high level notes üìù</h4></li>
<p>There was no way I could sit and absorb all of the information and visual stimuli on display at the conference. Taking high-level notes allowed me to maintain my focus on conference speakers while stopping only to write down information pertinent to me from each talk.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #4: Make a new connection everyday üëãüèø</h4></li>
<p>This tip is crucial for developers at all stages. Do not be afraid to say hello to someone new. Chances are they are nervous too. I made a few new connections by exchanging emails, reaching out on social media, and hanging out after hours.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #5: Ask questions ‚ùì</h4></li>
<p>Whether it is a conference speaker, sponsor, or peer, asking quality questions is crucial. I cannot wait to delve deeper into Machine Learning and put the knowledge I gained to use.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #6: Share your experience üó£Ô∏è</h4></li>
<p>Standing in a room full of accomplished industry professionals can be intimidating. However, we all have to start somewhere and have unique experiences to share. Sharing updates about my projects and receiving positive feedback felt good.</p>

<li><h4>Tip #7: Take pictures üì∏</h4></li>
<p>Document the moments that matter to you! I took a lot of pictures to preserve the memory of the occasion.</p>
<br></br>

<h3>Conclusion üí≠</h3>

<p>While there have been efforts to increase representation in the Swift community, progress has been slow. The lack of significant improvement could be due to broken interview practices, implicit bias or discrimination during the hiring process, and a failure to provide consistent material support. There is still much work to do.</p>

<p>I believe conferences should prioritize diversity and inclusion efforts, including actively seeking out and inviting Black speakers and attendees, providing mentorship and networking opportunities, and creating safe spaces for underrepresented groups. Organizers and attendees should be mindful of codes of conduct to ensure everyone feels respected and valued.</p>

<p>My first Swift conference was truly memorable. I got to explore a different city and try out the local cuisine. I learned something new from the various talks, met many great developers, and made new friends too! I was even fortunate enough to receive an affirming round of applause for my <a href="https://startdevelopfin.github.io/posts/codingdtc/">work mentoring last summer</a>. I will never forget that moment. If you are on the fence about attending a Swift conference, let this be the nudge you need to find your way to an event near you.</p>

<h3>Call to Action üö®</h3>

<p><blockquote><i>"Photo of Paul Hudson's closing keynote slide"</i></blockquote></p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws">Paul Hudson's </a> entire closing keynote was sensational. He took the stage and implored attendees to avoid bickering over superficial coding debates and focus on what matters -- building the apps we care about, looking for opportunities to provide mentorship regardless of our experience, challenging the status quo, and moving forward together.</p>

<p>I have a similar ask for every reader from the Swift community: Find a way to make an impact and foster positive change. Maybe that looks like lobbying for paid internships or entry-level support where you work. Perhaps that looks like joining an organization like <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org">Underdog Devs</a> and providing sponsorship or mentorship for aspiring developers. We all have a role to play. The future of the Swift community depends on the actions we take right now.</p><br></br>
